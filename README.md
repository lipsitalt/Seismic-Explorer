An Interactive Analysis of Global Earthquakes
Welcome to an interactive dashboard visualizing global seismic activity from 1900 to 2013. This comprehensive tool allows you to explore the frequency, depth, and magnitude of earthquakes, with a special focus on quakes with 6+ magnitude.

The data sourced from Kaggle([https://lnkd.in/g6KvSHyk](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varunsaikanuri/earthquakes-from-1900-2013)) and visualized in Tableau reveals Vanuatu, an island country in Oceania, as the epicenter of activity with 349 recorded earthquakes over the century. On average, the Earth shakes 68 times a year, with a median depth of 41.4 km and a median magnitude of 6.5. Most earthquakes occur within a shallow range of 0-50 km and fall within a magnitude range of 6 to 6.25, underscoring the rarity of high-magnitude tremors.

A significant increase in seismic activity is noticeable starting around 1960, peaking around 2011. This trend signals increasing pressure on Earth’s surface, a testament to our planet’s dynamic nature. The record-breaking quake? A 9.6 magnitude giant in Valdivia, Chile on May 22, 1960, reaching 35km deep.

The ‘Ms’ type is the most recorded, and March stands out as the most active month. To journey through seismic history, use the slider to adjust the start and end dates on the top of the dashboard for a dynamic visualization of earthquakes over time. And for a captivating view of the history of earthquakes, find the ‘Play’ button(a right-pointing triangle), situated at the base of the Earthquake Timelapse map.
